1.  clone the repository
2.  make a branch with the name of the task
3.  make the changes
4.  commit the changes into your branch
5.  when the changes are aproved make merge into **DEV** branch. Never merge into **MAIN** branch

## Next JS Enviroment and flow

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
